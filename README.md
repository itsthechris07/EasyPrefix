# EasyPrefix

## Preamble
Hey there!
Thank you for your interest in my project "EasyPrefix".

This page attempts to answer questions that people tend to have when they first discover EasyPrefix.

## What is EasyPrefix?
EasyPrefix is a chat formatting solution for spigot. The plugin comes with many preformed chat formattings and an easy-to-use gui. The plugin is translated in english, german and italien.

## Reasons to use
With the plugin you have the possibility to create an infinite number of chat prefixes and suffixes. In addition,
players can set their default chat color in the gui - so you don't need additional plugins. EasyPrefix is fully
compatible if PlaceholdersAPI. You find a list of all placeholders <here>.

## How does it work?
EasyPrefix is fully dynamically. You can create an infinite number of chat prefixes/groups. Messages can be changed and translated in the config.
